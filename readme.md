# Depleting Ores Mod

A mod for vintage story that implements ore blocks with infinite(or specified) yield that deplete in quality as it is mined.

### Completed Features:
- [x] [Ore blocks with extended yield.](#ore-blocks-with-extended-yield)
- [x] [World generation of depleting ores.](#world-generation-of-depleting-ores)
- [ ] [Depleting quality of yield.](#depleting-quality-of-yield)
- [ ] [Margin variation in yield quality.](#minor-variations-in-yield-quality)
- [ ] [Ore yield quantity options via config.](#ore-yield-quantity-settings-via-config)

### Ore blocks with extended yield
Ores can be mined multiple times extending the amount of yield.

### World generation of depleting ores
Ores generated by the world generator are depleting ores.

### Depleting quality of yield
The quality of the yield will decrease as the ore depletes.
An fresh ore start drop high quality chunks, but then due to depletion later only drop nuggets.

### Minor variations in yield quality
A random chance introducing minor variation error in yield. ex. (+/-) 3 ore nuggets.

### Ore yield quantity settings via config
Ability to specify settings such as yield-amount, depletion-rate, variation, and more via a config file.
